This tool is designed to use mainly by streamers, with OBS or other streaming tools that can take a local URL, to display an overlay with your character stats.
Eventually, a non-streamer may find it useful if run on a separate monitor, because it makes it easier to read your stats.

## Download

[Windows 64-bit installer](https://github.com/zeddicus-pl/d2rSpeedRun/releases/latest/download/d2rspeedruntool-setup.exe)

## How it works

It works by watching a selected folder for latest updated .d2s file, and then grabs some stats from it.

Due to how Diablo 2 works, the save file is updated (around) **each 5 minutes, or when you identify any item, or obviously when you close & save the game**.

This means that the displayed data **updates each few minutes**. It's not great, but that's the best that could be currently done with Diablo 2 Resurrected without reading game memory (which may be detectable by the game, and may result in ban...)
